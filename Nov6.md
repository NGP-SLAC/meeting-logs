# SLAC (Stay Late And Code) First Meeting

## What do you want to get out of SLAC?

We did a quick sticky-note exercise to answer the question and clustered the answers to common categories.

Four major categories: (sub-categories are the actual sticky-note entries)
- Learn new skills
  * Learn a new language
  * Obtain more coding experience as the matlab bootcamp is far from enough
  * Some programming tricks / ideas helpful for maintaining the code
  * Learn a language / tool in detail
  * How to store / clean the data into a more reusable and usable structure.
  * Learn new skills
  * Math or concepts relating to data analysis
  * Try to create something fun and learn from it
- Personal motivation
  * Be more motivated to try and learn new things by time-boxing
  * I get more motivated / code better with other people around
  * Make programming a hobby
  * I am a person who easily gives up. Working in group pushes me forward
  * Socialize and talk regularly to other people
- Knowledge sharing
  * Create a platform for sharing knowledge
  * Document for future me and other people 
  * Create a reusable project frameworks for later (i.e data processing for certain experimental data)
  * Build a workflow for future research projects
  * Get mentorship while learning to code
  * Place to ask questions about coding
  * Try processing / learn about different types of data (i.e imaging, ephys, sequencing, etc)
- Collaboration
  * Motivation to collaborate and learn from people of diverse backgrounds
  * Socialize and talk to other people from the program
  * Learn / get to know what it is like to cooperate on projects
  * Generally learn how coding guys collaborate
  * Collaboration on projects through git, etc.
  * How to do code reviews

## Ideas for things we can try at SLAC
- Quick stand up meetings - everyone quickly updates on what they will do, what they've been up to, what they need help with, etc.
- Swarming - if someone needs help / has a problem interesting enough for a group effort, s/he presents the details to the group, and get a collective effort from the group
- Coding help stations - anyone can come in for a quick question / advice / debugging
- Getting data / project ideas from NGP labs - we can work on it, and potentially turn it into an educational material.

## Action Items
- Ask Morgan to advertise the SLAC meeting to all NGP
- Setup Github
- Github Tutorials
